## Motivation

Xenium data’s strength lies in its ability to determine cell shapes and visualize various data aspects onto the cells, their shapes, and their spatial relationships. However, generating visualizations of different tissue regions with varying annotation details can be a significant challenge. This `shiny` App aims to alleviate the pain points associated with generating zoomed-in visualizations.
